# Firebase Authentication App
 

 ### Welcome to the Firebase Authentication App! This application is built using React, Firebase Authentication, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a platform for users to register, log in, and manage their accounts securely. The app also includes features like light/dark mode, toaster notifications, and a simple dashboard.

## Features
### User Registration and Login
#### Users can create an account (sign up) and log in securely using Firebase Authentication. After successful registration, users are redirected to the login page.

### Dashboard
#### Upon successful login, users are redirected to a dashboard page where they can see a simple interface and a logout button. The page is a placeholder for future user-specific features.

### Logout Functionality
#### Users can securely log out from the dashboard.

### Toaster Notifications
#### Notifications appear as toasts when certain actions are performed (e.g., successful registration, login, etc.). They are displayed for 5 seconds and are centered on the screen for better visibility.
